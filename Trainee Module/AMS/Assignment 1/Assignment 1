Examining the schematic, we notice a voltage divider circuit. The VBATM pin is connected to HV-, while the VBATP pin is connected between two resistors that bridge HV+ and HV-. This configuration is chosen due to the IC's voltage ratings.

Input voltage reading of VBATM
Input voltage reading of VBATP

VMax = 378 V
R14 = 30 * 10^3
R17 = 6.5 * 10^6

V14 = VBATP - VBATM

Voltage across the accumulator =  (V14 * R17)/(R14) + V14
